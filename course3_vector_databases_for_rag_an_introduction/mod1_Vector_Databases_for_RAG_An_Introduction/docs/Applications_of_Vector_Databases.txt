Welcome to this video
where you can explore how companies and individuals
use vector databases. After watching this video, you will be able to; describe how you can use vector databases to
analyze images and video, explain how vector databases
enable recommendations, describe vector
databases that support geospatial analysis and
location-based services, and summarize how
vector databases deliver social and
marketing insights. You can use vector databases to perform feature extraction
and representation, similarity searches, and
process real-time data. Vector databases store
high-dimensional feature vectors to perform feature extraction
and representation. You can then view
aspects of images, such as color histograms, texture descriptions, or
deep learning embeddings. Similarity searches use a
vector database's ability to store feature vectors. You can employ these
capabilities to locate images, summarize videos, and suggest images and
videos based on content. Real-time access vector
databases provide horizontal scalability for
real-time data storage. You can use these capabilities to perform video surveillance, object recognition, and
live event analysis. For example, a
photo-sharing app stores embeddings or small versions of user photos in a vector library. When you add a new image, the app looks at the
embedding to see if it matches the other
photos in the database. If the photo resembles
other photos, the recommendation
system suggests other similar photos that can be used to tag or organize albums. Next, let's explore some applications of
system recommendations. Embedded storage and
nearest neighbor search incorporate numerical
representations of items or entities known as embeddings generated by
the recommendation system. You can access the vector
data's likes and traits to provide improved
personalized suggestions. To deliver performance
improvement and scalability vector
databases provide scalability to handle
additional searches and vectors that improve query
processing and indexing. These capabilities power fast, scalable recommendation
services for large numbers of
concurrent users. Vector databases provide cross-domain suggestions
using embeddings, enhancing recommendation
system's completeness. For example, a streaming service keeps movie embeddings
in a vector library. After you watch a movie the
system uses embeddings of related movies from the database to recommend other
movies you might like. To store and index data
efficiently vector databases use indexing methods like R-tree or quadtree to store geospatial
data like addresses, polygons, GPS
locations, and more. These capabilities
provide answers for spatial queries like
closeness searches, range queries, and spatial joins for GPS information and
other mapping needs. Another task is the provision of location-based suggestions. Vector databases combine
geospatial data with user preferences and
location information to suggest nearby events, services, and
places of interest. Vector databases specialize in delivering real-time
geospatial analytics. Vector databases can process
real-time streaming data, group items together spatially, and recognize spatial patterns. These capabilities power apps
like vehicle trafficking, fleet management,
dynamic vehicle routing, and even locating hotspots. Imagine you are on
vacation and using a navigation app to
locate a restaurant. The navigation app uses
a vector database to store the GPS locations of
places to eat and visit. The app checks the database
and provides a list of restaurants within a certain distance of your location. Vector databases provide
distributed storage and parallel processing for horizontal scalability
by distributing data and queries across
multiple nodes or groups. This capability
enables marketing and social sites to
process big data and handle simultaneous queries for SEO calculations and
user profile management. To reduce latency and boost overall speed, vector
databases also use optimized caching and
query execution plans. These capabilities
speed the delivery of trending analytics to
influencers and advertisers. Vector databases support
autoscaling and dynamic resource allocation to adjust to the ever-changing
number of task. This capability enables
your company to scale hardware and cloud
resource usage for the best performance
and lower costs. An example of a vector database
used for marketing and social media is a
site that maintains user profiles and keeps
track of their hobbies, such as cycling,
running, and swimming. As the number of users grows, the platform adds more hardware for the databases to handle the extra work of maintaining user profiles and
tracking user interests, including clicks on
products they like without slowing down
response times. In this video, you learned that; organizations can make
data-driven apps that work well and can be expanded to many areas using
their strengths. You can use vector databases for image and video analysis, including feature aspects,
similarity searches, and real-time data processing. Vector databases
use embeddings and cross-domain
suggestions to enhance the completeness of
recommendation systems. GPS, fleet management, and real-time traffic routing
suggestions are built on vector database geospatial
processing capabilities. Vector databases
enable marketing and social sites to scale resources
to manage user profiles, deliver trend analysis, and optimize their Cloud
and other hardware use.
